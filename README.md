# NFL_Combine_LogReg
Looked at data from the NFL 2000 through 2020 combines and used a logistic regression to see if we could determine whether or not a player would get drafted.

Multiple models were created using different variables in addition to the combine data. I also did separate models for position. Most models were around 68% accurate.
